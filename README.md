# NFT-DAO
Build a DAO for NFT holders

- Anyone with a BinnaDevs NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from an NFT marketplace.
- Everyone with a BinnaDev NFT can vote for or against the active proposals.
- Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal.
- A voter cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT.
- If a majority of voters vote in favor of the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase is automatic.Â
